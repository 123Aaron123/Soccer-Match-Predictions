# Improving-Soccer-Match-Predictions
In the soccer match prediction project our group developed a robust infrastructure for validation and model
comparison across both classification and regression tasks. We leveraged techniques such as hyperparameter
tuning, cross-validation, and model ensembling to improve model performance and get better predictions. This
approach allowed for an efficient evaluation of various models, ensuring that the selected models were not only
well-tuned but also demonstrated superior performance in predicting outcomes.
